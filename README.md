# MultiMeta
Multi Metadata analysis and export without Windows 10 admin privileges for videofiles with MediaInfo CLI written in Batch.


This projekt startet with the need to analyse the metadata of countless videofiles at my work. This process often included much more than 500 files per day.
As [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) is already used on site, I used the CLI version of MediaInfo.

The computers we use on site are heavily restricted by our Administrators and are also part of an Office365 environment which forced the use of many *workarounds* to not trigger the UAC.
