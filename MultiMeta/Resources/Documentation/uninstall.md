## Uninstall
Uninstall is easily done with executing **uninstall_MultiMeta.bat** under *C:\MultiMeta*.
This script will have the following effects:
- Desktop shortcuts (local and Windows365) will get deleted
- Temp files will get deleted
- Start menu entry will get deleted
- Explorer.exe will get stopped, program directory and the uninstall script will get deleted and Explorer.exe will get restarted (cleanest way so far)
