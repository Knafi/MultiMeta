 ## Report
 Once the analysing part is finished a HTML report is created.  
 From here on it is possible to use the build-in functions **Print**, **Print to PDF** and **Open in Excel**  

 Empty cells can mean two things:
 1.  One empty cell under Scan-Type most likely means progressive but MediaInfo doesn't get a value out of the file
 2.  Multiple empty cells means that the the file is truncated

To open the report in Excel you just have to click OK here.  
**Note: That as of now it only works in Office 365 Excel.**

Once in Excel you have to activate the [Office Data Connection](/MultiMeta/Resources/Documentation/ODC.md).
